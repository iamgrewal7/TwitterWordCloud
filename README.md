# Creating Word from Twitter Data

In the project I extracted 2000 tweets from Twitter, using Twitter API, into two equal sized datasets. First dataset contain random tweets while the second is the result when "COVID-19" is searched on Twitter.
Both the datasets were cleaned and compared using Venn Diagrams before creating the word clouds.
